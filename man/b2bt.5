.Sh NAME
.Nm b2bt XML files
.Nd back-to-back testing utility's format for test suites
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm b2bt
utility aims to automate:
.Bl -bullet
.It
back-to-back testing (testing a command-line utility against another implementation)
.It
non regression testing (testing a command-line utility against a previous version)
.El
.Pp
It processes one or more XML files describing the test suite for a command-line utility,
with its different test cases, execute the 2 commands versions and report potential
differences (on return codes, standard output, standard error output, plus custom post
processing output in order to check other kind of impacts, on file systems, execution time, etc.).
.Pp
In a test suite it is possible to specify:
.Bl -bullet
.It
optional shell commands to execute before the test, typically to setup the test environment in an automatically generated test sub directory
.It
optional standard input to be injected in the command tested
.It
mandatory one line shell command-line for the command to be tested
.It
optional shell commands to execute after the test, typically to analyze the tested command impact on the test environment.
The output of these "post" commands is captured before automatic removal of the test sub directory
.El
.Pp
Each test case can have a name and a potential timeout (in seconds or fraction of seconds).
.Pp
A
.Nm
XML file starts with a line indicating the XML version we use:
.Bd -literal
<?xml version="1.0"?>
.Ed
.Pp
Then, all the rest of the file is enclosed between 1 test-suite pair of tags: 
.Bd -literal
<test-suite program="COMMAND" processor="b2bt" ID="@(#) $Id: COMMAND.xml - back to back test suite for COMMAND v1.0.0 (DATE) by AUTHOR $">
</test-suite>
.Ed
.Pp
Where:
.Bl -bullet
.It
.Em COMMAND
is the name of the command to be tested
.It
.Em DATE
is the date of last modification to the file
.It
.Em AUTHOR
is the test suite author's name
.El
.Pp
You can then have 1 or more test-cases enclosed between test-case pair of tags:
.Bd -literal
<test-case name="CASE_NAME" timeout="TIMEOUT">
  <cmd>
    COMMAND
  </cmd>
</test-case>
.Ed
.Pp
Where:
.Bl -bullet
.It
The
.Em name
attribute is optional but recommended. If you don't provide it, the test will be referred to by its order rank in the file (starting at 1)
.It
The
.Em timeout
attribute is optional and it's recommended NOT to use it, unless you have a good reason to do so. It takes a positive value, with an eventual decimal part, expressed in seconds. Whatever the Locale you are using, the decimal separator is the "." character
.It
.Em CASE_NAME
is a short string describing the test case
.It
.Em COMMAND
is the command to be shell executed:
.Bl -bullet
.It
the
.Em cmd
tag expects exactly one line. Leading or trailing spaces and newline characters are stripped
.It
the command itself must be pathless. b2bt will replace the first occurrence it founds with the absolute path of the original or new command to be tested
.It
the command is executed by a Shell. Its output can be piped to another command or redirected to a file, and it can be prefixed by environment variables definition
.El
.El
.Pp
Apart from the mandatory
.Em cmd
tags, a test-case can also include the following optional tags:
.Bd -literal
<test-case name="CASE_NAME" timeout="TIMEOUT">
  <pre>
    PRE_COMMANDS
  </pre> 
  <stdin>
    INPUT_LINES
  </stdin> 
  <cmd>
    COMMAND
  </cmd>
  <post>
    POST_COMMANDS
  </post> 
</test-case>
.Ed
.Pp
Where:
.Bl -bullet
.It
.Em PRE_COMMANDS
is 0 to N lines of commands to be shell executed before the command to be tested:
.Bl -bullet
.It
These commands are independent from each other. This is not a shell script! Peculiarly, you can't use "here documents" or environment variables definition affecting succeeding lines...
.It
This section is intended to create any files or directories with associated content needed for the test case. It will be executed twice, for the original and the new command, so that each one runs in a fresh environment
.El
.It
.Em POST_COMMANDS
does the same, except its commands are executed after the command to be tested and their output is collected for later comparisons:
.Bl -bullet
.It
This section is intended to check additional effects of the command tested, for example in terms of files/directories creation/modification/deletion, execution duration, etc.
.It
The temporary directory where the test happens will automatically be cleaned, and this doesn't need to be addressed by the user
.El
.It
.Em INPUT_LINES
is 0 to N lines of text to be injected as standard input into the command to be tested. Again, leading or trailing spaces and newline characters are stripped
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
A minimal test suite would be:
.Bd -literal
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<test-suite program="basename" processor="b2bt" ID="@(#) $Id: basename.xml - back to back test suite for basename v1.0.0 (May 30, 2021) by Hubert Tournier $">
  <test-case name="Typical usage - removing directories and file extension">
    <cmd>
      basename /directory1/directory2/file1.ext .ext
    </cmd>
  </test-case>
</test-suite>
.Ed
.Pp
Another more sophisticated test suite would be:
.Bd -literal
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<test-suite program="cat" processor="b2bt" ID="@(#) $Id: cat.xml - back to back test suite for cat v1.0.0 (May 30, 2021) by Hubert Tournier $">
  <test-case name="Concatenate 2 files">
    <pre>
      printf "%s\\n%s\\n%s\\n" a b c > 1
      printf "%s\\n%s\\n%s\\n" d e f > 2
    </pre>
    <cmd>
      cat 1 2
    </cmd>
    <post>
     find .
     echo
     cat 1
     echo
     cat 2
    </post>
  </test-case>

  <test-case name="Basic filter - process standard input">
    <stdin>
      a
      b
      c
    </stdin>
    <cmd>
      cat
    </cmd>
  </test-case>
</test-suite>

.Sh HISTORY
These files were made for
.Lk https://github.com/HubTou/PNU [The PNU project / PyNIX]
in order to test the rewritten commands against the installed ones.
.Pp
This project will provide
.Nm
test files for the usual POSIX and FreeBSD commands.

A way to introduce leading or trailing spaces in tag contents has yet to be provided.
